         <h2>Westville Pizza</h2
             <p>883 Whalley Avenue<br/>
             New Haven, CT 06511</p>
         
         <h3>The Review</h3>
         <p>Westville Pizza was started by a cousin of Frank Pepe, of Pepe's Pizza. It has since been sold, and the new owners and operators are Turkish, and I am happy to say they have continued the same style of pizza, and it is still just as delicous.  They also offer various mediterranean dishes.</p>
