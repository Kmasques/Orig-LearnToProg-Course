         <p>Margaret Atwood on the Difference Between Prose and Poetry:<br/><br/>
             
Poetry is a form of thought, not expression, Margaret Atwood explains in this 1968 interview on her new poetry collection The Animals in That Country.<br/><br/>

CBC Host Bill McNeil asks Atwood what message she's trying to send with her poetry, but Atwood says it's impossible to translate.<br/><br/>

"That's thinking of poetry as a translation from prose, as though one were thinking in prose and then translating it into poetry as a form of expression. Whereas one actually thinks in poetry," Atwood says."You can't separate what I'm saying from the actual form in which its said. Do you ask a painter, what is this painting saying?"<br/><br/>

In this brief interview, Atwood talks about starting to write plays, comic books and novels around the age of five and then stopping about five years later. She wouldn't become interested in writing again until she was a teenager.<br/><br/>

"I wanted to be a home economist when I was in high school and that 's what I prepared myself for, unfortunately, because I never learned to type and suddenly I began writing again with no warning," said Atwood.<br/><br/> 

"It interested me more than anything else, so I forgot about the rest of it."<br/>
